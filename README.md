# Hi! I'm FetchFox

FetchFox is an AI powered web scraper. It takes the raw text of a website, and uses AI to extract data the user is looking for. It runs as a Chrome Extension, and the user describes the desired data in plain English.

You can use FetchFox to quickly gather data like building a list of leads, assembling research data, or scoping out a market segment.

By scraping raw text with AI, FetchFox lets you circumvent anti-scraping measures on sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Even the the complicated HTML structures are possible to parse with FetchFox.
